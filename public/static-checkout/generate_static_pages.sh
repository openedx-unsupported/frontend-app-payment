# This script is used to minify the separated html, css and js files
# They are separated as the available npm packages don't work with combined html/css/js
# Once the files are minified, this script calls the python script that generates the static pages
# You may need to install the minification utilities globally, like this:
#   npm install -g html-minifier cssnano-cli uglify-js
# You should run the script from the static-checkout directory 
#   ./generate_static_pages.sh
# Example url of a static page generated by the script: http://localhost:1998/public/static-checkout/pages/0A60B3A.html
